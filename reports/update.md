# Tough Triangles: Graphics in Vulcan
## Trevor and Andrew D.


The goal of our project was to learn about computer graphics in C++ through Vulkan. Our lower bound goal was drawing a triangle and our upper bound goal was point source lighting and diffuse shading.


Trevor: I think learning about an exciting application of C++ or C. Getting into this slimy of an api with lots of complicated structures is also going to be a new experience for me. Andrew: I would love to learn about how computer graphics are handled on modern systems. If we managed to implement any sort of ray tracing I would be thrilled, but Iâ€™ll take an image processed by the GPU.

We have started to setup our graphics pipeline and swap chain on our way to making our triangle. We realized that there is a ton of setup that goes into making something even as simple as a triangle so we have been following a tutorial series that goes over different topics in computer graphics and how to set them up in Vulkan, and just absorbing as much as we can.

Add configurations for our input assemblies in graphics pipeline- Trevor 
Configure viewport and scissor- Andrew 
Configure Rasteurization variables - Andrew
Done for  all of these is when we can compile our graphics pipeline without errors.
