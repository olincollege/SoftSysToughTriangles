# Tough Triangles: Graphics in Vulcan

## Learnings From the Last Project
Trevor: Last project was fun! I learned a lot of theoretical stuff but didn’t cover much c specific tools. I think our project is going to be very C++ specific so it will be a different learning experience. I also am working in a group this time so the workflow will be different.
Andrew: Destroying League of Legends was a blast, and I got to experiment with windows applications and the windows API. I don’t think there were many technically complicated programming concepts, so this project should offer a different type of challenge. 


# Goals For This Project
Our goal is to learn how to use Vulcan to do graphics programming. Our lower bound is to make a triangle (it seems pretty tough). Our upper bound is 3d rendering with user input for perspective. Or raytracing.

## Learning Goals
Trevor: I think learning about an exciting application of C++ or C. Getting into this slimy of an api with lots of complicated structures is also going to be a new experience for me.
Andrew: I would love to learn about how computer graphics are handled on modern systems. If we managed to implement any sort of ray tracing I would be thrilled, but I’ll take an image processed by the GPU. 


## Resources
There are lots of online resources for getting to the triangle so we’ll start there and see what happens.
